**Trigger Location**: The vulnerability is triggered in the network service program (boa) through the formSetWanDhcpplus function during execution at the statement `sprintf(v68, "%s?t=%s", last_url, Var);`.

**POC (Proof of Concept)**:
 POST Request to `/goform/formSetWanDhcpplus` with the following headers:

- `Content-Length: 6158`
- `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`

**Vulnerability Description**:
 Dlink DIR-513 uses the boa program to provide web service. This program initializes services via the `websAspInit` function, setting several callback APIs. When a POST request is made to `/goform/formSetWanDhcpplus`, it triggers the `formSetWanDhcpplus` callback function. The function extracts the `curTime` parameter from the request body and concatenates it into a stack variable using `sprintf(v68, "%s?t=%s", last_url, Var);`. Since the length of `curTime` is not properly checked, it can overflow the stack and cause a denial of service. This vulnerability can be further exploited to gain shell access to the device.

**Temporary Solution**: Add a length check for the `curTime` parameter.
 **Permanent Solution**: Add a length check for the `curTime` parameter.
